# Introduction
Welcome to Fluxtion service starter, hope you enjoy exploring :)

The service starter manages the deterministic execution of start and stop tasks for a set of interdependent services. 
Tasks are triggered on services as parent services are successfully completed. 

## Overview
In many systems services execute independently but need to co-ordinate their lifecycle with each other. A service
may require all downstream services to be started before starting and becoming available to accept upstream requests.

Similarly, if a downstream service becomes unavailable all upstream services will need to be notified and take appropriate
actions.

As systems grow a complex graph of interdependent services quickly arises, the difficulty in correctly managing
lifecycle overwhelms a handwritten manual solution. Service starter is a library utility that manages the 
lifecycle of independent services, executing start and stop tasks associated with a particular service at the correct time.

### Main components
- **[ServiceManager](//github.com/gregv12/fluxtion-service-starter/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fluxtion/example/servicestater/ServiceManager.java)** 
  manages the execution of lifecycle tasks associated with a service. The server places all  clients requests on a 
  queue and executes them on its own thread.
- **[ServiceManager absoloute](https://github.com/gregv12/fluxtion-service-starter/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fluxtion/example/servicestater/ServiceManager.java)** 
- **[Service](https://github.com/gregv12/example-service-starter/blob/e9a6d092f492cd89060abc717c70f6539cf8f856/src/main/java/com/fluxtion/example/servicestater/Service.java#L20)** - To manage a user service a proxy Service is instantiated and registered with the ServiceManagerServer.
  An external service has a one to one mapping with a Service. Data held by the Service:
    - name - a unique service name that can be identified globally
    - dependents - Upstream services that require this service to be started for validity
    - start task - an optional task that is executed when the service enters the STARTING lifecycle phase
    - stop task - an optional task that is executed when the service enters the STOPPING lifecycle phase
- **Consumer<List<TaskWrapper>>** Consumes start/stop tasks generated by the ServiceManagerServer. A default implementation
  is provided, ServiceTaskExecutor, that executes tasks on its own executor thread.
