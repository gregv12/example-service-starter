# Controlling services
This section covers the programming model and concepts a developer needs to understand when controlling running services
through the ServiceManager.

### Executing a model
Once the server has been successfully built client code interacts in with the server:
- Starting/stopping individual services by name
- Starting/stopping all services
- When a service changes state, notify the server with the appropriate method and service name


### Threading
ServiceManagerServer is threadsafe, all methods return immediately and a request is placed onto a queue for execution.
A single thread pulls the request from the queue and then reads/writes the underlying model.

A task list may be produced by the ServiceManagerServer and pushed to a registered consumer. A ServiceTaskExecutor
instance is registered with the ServiceManagerServer by default. The ServiceTaskExecutor executes all tasks on its own
thread.

- serviceManagerThread-(n) processes client requests to the ServiceManager
- taskExecutor-(n) executes tasks generated by the ServiceManager
