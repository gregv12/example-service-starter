# Controlling services
This section covers the programming model and concepts a developer needs to understand when controlling running services
through the ServiceManager.

## Service

### Service lifecycle
The service starter manages a set of services with the following behaviour
1. A service can be started if all its dependencies are in a STARTED state
2. A service can be started if it has no dependencies
3. A call to ServiceManager.start() will start any services that have no dependencies
4. Any service the FluxtionSystemManager starts will move to the STARTING state, and a [start command](https://github.com/gregv12/example-service-starter/blob/d15d4856af4f0315d08474de5fda74f849886757/src/main/java/com/fluxtion/example/servicestater/ServiceEvent.java#L57) will be published
5. Any dependencies of a STARTING service will move to WAITING_FOR_PARENTS_TO_START state
6. A service moves to STARTED state when a StatusUpdate with STARTED state is invoked by calling FluxtionSystemManager.processStatusUpdate()
7. When all dependencies of a WAITING_FOR_PARENTS_TO_START service have STARTED state this service will be started, see (4) above
9. Continues down the dependency tree until all services are started

Stopping has the same behaviour for the reverse dependency order.

### Service states
    STATUS_UNKNOWN
    WAITING_FOR_PARENTS_TO_START
    STARTING
    STARTED
    WAITING_FOR_PARENTS_TO_STOP
    STOPPING
    STOPPED


### Executing a model
Once the server has been successfully built client code interacts in with the server:
- Starting/stopping individual services by name
- Starting/stopping all services
- When a service changes state, notify the server with the appropriate method and service name


### Threading
ServiceManagerServer is threadsafe, all methods return immediately and a request is placed onto a queue for execution.
A single thread pulls the request from the queue and then reads/writes the underlying model.

A task list may be produced by the ServiceManagerServer and pushed to a registered consumer. A ServiceTaskExecutor
instance is registered with the ServiceManagerServer by default. The ServiceTaskExecutor executes all tasks on its own
thread.

- serviceManagerThread-(n) processes client requests to the ServiceManager
- taskExecutor-(n) executes tasks generated by the ServiceManager
